# Odoo External API Scripts

This repository contains a set of scripts I created to make my life easier as a Customer Success Manager at Odoo.

I use the scripts contained in this repository as small internal tools to perform activities or automate tasks that are not possible to do within Odoo itself.

The scripts are written in Python and use Odoo External API, which is describe in the official documentation in this link:
